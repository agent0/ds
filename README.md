# My data structures

This project is a collection of some basic data strutures that I use frequently in my projects.
The data structures are taylored towards my personal needs and thus may not be universally usable.

## Tree

The tree is the most advanced data struture of the collection. It is a collection container that arranges the elements 
in a tree-like structure. Each element can only be added to the tree once (as in a set). The elements that are managed 
by the container do not have to implement a particular interface or extend a given base class. Instead, the container 
internally wraps each element within an internal object that manages the relationships with other elements.
 
A tree can have multiple root nodes, thus making it effectively a _forrest_. Since this denomination is far
less known than the term _tree_, I will stick with the latter term.
